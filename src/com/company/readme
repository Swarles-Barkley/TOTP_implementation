Both the get-otp and generate-qr portions of the program are written to interact with
a particular key. Because I was unable to find and implement third party software
to encode and decode in base 32 (and go from this to hexadecimal for the TOTP infras-
tructure provided) I was unable to write a general solution, but was able to write a com-
plete solution for the key "123456712345671234567." Because my phone had problems inter-
acting with GA (primarily an inability to use the '8' or '9' characters) I was unable to
debug as thoroughly as I'd hope, but believe the solution works anyway.
